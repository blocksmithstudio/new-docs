Here is a quick guide on how to install NextCollectors on your Minecraft server.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Download the Plugin

First, download the latest version of NextCollectors from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nextcollectors-1-20-1-21-4-optimized-for-large-servers-with-upgrades-transaction-logs-and-more.121517/), or [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/nextcollectors.57201/?ref=discover).

<Callout type="warning">**Be alert:** This plugin is only available on its official [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nextcollectors-1-20-1-21-4-optimized-for-large-servers-with-upgrades-transaction-logs-and-more.121517/), [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/nextcollectors.57201/?ref=discover) pages. 
Any versions found on third-party sites like 9Minecraft.net are **unauthorized and may contain malware**. Always download from official sources to stay safe.</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Upload:

After downloading the `.jar` file, upload it to the `plugins` directory of your server.  If you're in **Pterodactyl** Panel you can find the `plugins` directory in the `Files` tab.
</Step>

<Step>
#### Done

After putting the `.jar` file in the `plugins` directory, restart your server.

If you want to check if the plugin is installed correctly, you can run the following command in the server console:

```bash
/plugins
```

or

```bash
/pl
```

If NextCollectors is installed correctly, you should see it in the list of plugins.
But if you see NextCollectors turn red, it means that the plugin is not installed correctly.
You can ask for support in the [_support server_](https://discord.gg/nextcollectors).
