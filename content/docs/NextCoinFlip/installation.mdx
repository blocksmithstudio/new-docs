Here is a quick guide on how to install NextCoinFlip on your Minecraft server.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Download the Plugin

First, download the latest version of NextCoinFlip from [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/nextcoinflip.79319/).

<Callout type="warning">**Be alert:** This plugin is only available on its official [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/nextcoinflip.79319/) pages. 
Any versions found on third-party sites like 9Minecraft.net are **unauthorized and may contain malware**. Always download from official sources to stay safe.</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Upload:

After downloading the `.jar` file, upload it to the `plugins` directory of your server.  If you're in **Pterodactyl** Panel you can find the `plugins` directory in the `Files` tab.
</Step>

<Step>
#### Done

After putting the `.jar` file in the `plugins` directory, restart your server.

If you want to check if the plugin is installed correctly, you can run the following command in the server console:

```bash
/plugins
```

or

```bash
/pl
```

If NextCoinFlip is installed correctly, you should see it in the list of plugins.
But if you see NextCoinFlip turn red, it means that the plugin is not installed correctly.
