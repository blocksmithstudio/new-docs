But firstly we need to put this plugin as our depedencies. And how do we do that?
We provide a tutorial on how to do that just by below here!

<Steps>
<Step>
First put this code in your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.muhammaddaffaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>NextCoinFlip</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/libs/NextCoinFlip.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```
If you're using Gradle, put this code in your `build.gradle` file

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation files("${projectDir}/libs/NextCoinFlip.jar")
}
```

</Step>
<Step>
Secondly after you added NextCoinFlip to your dependencies, you can now use it in your code!

If you're going to call the API, example on getting the User Statistic

```java

private void getUserStatistic(Player player) {
    User user = UserRepository.getUser(player);
    CoinflipStatistic coinflipStatistic = user.getStatistic();
    // Do something with the coinflipStatistic
}
```

And that's it! You can now use NextCoinFlips API in your code!
